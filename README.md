# Attendance-management
An attendance management system using T-sql/Ms Sql Server

# Overview
In this project, we aim to build a Biometric-based Attendance Management System. The attendance of the students is recorded by obtaining their biometrics when they enter and leave the allotted classrooms for their respective courses. Four biometric-sensors shall be installed in each classroom and the students may record their attendance using any of the four sensors. The live data obtained from the sensors is used to keep track of the attendance of every student in each of the courses they have enrolled for as well as subject-wise attendance of every course that the institute offers. The database is designed with the help of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
